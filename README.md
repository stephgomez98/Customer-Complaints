Through inspection can see that the date_received and date submitted return negaive numbers so will makw those dates null:
--counting how many incorrect values are in there
select count(complaint_id) as countcomplaint
from (
select complaint_id,date_received,
case when date_submitted>date_received then NULL
else date_submitted
end as date_submitted
from complaints_data) as subquery
 where date_submitted is NULL
 --counting how many incorrect values are in there
--updating the original database
UPDATE complaints_data
SET 
    date_submitted = CASE 
                        WHEN date_submitted > date_received THEN NULL
                        ELSE date_submitted
